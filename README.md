# ML-Classification-Clustering

This repository contains machine learning models for classification and clustering tasks. It includes implementations of Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes for classification, and K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for clustering.

## Datasets Used

- **Diabetes Prediction Dataset**: Used for classification tasks (Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes). The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
- **Wine Clustering Dataset**: Used for clustering tasks (K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models). The goal is to group similar wines based on their chemical properties.

## Models Implemented

### 1. **Logistic Regression**
- Logistic Regression is a linear model for binary classification that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

### 2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features. The Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that the features follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

### 3. **K-Means Clustering**
- K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

### 4. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**
- GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It is used for clustering and density estimation.
